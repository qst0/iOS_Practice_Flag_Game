# iOS_Practice_Flag_Game
Learning iOS, Xcode and Swift with an app a day (Day 3)

Inspired and guided by the tutorial at: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/2

Applying my knowledge from the other two days of app dev I've been doing this week too!

It seems lots of the details in these tutorials are hazy and chanign with the newer versions of xcode and swift.

I polished a few things about the app for my own artistic reasons:

Such as the view when the iPhone or iPad is turned to the side.

I made the background grey, easy stuff like that!

I also made the country name / queston look nicer too

I might even return to theme the game for MetaHobby at a later date!

**If you are following this tutorial too or have any questions**

There is no better way to learn!
